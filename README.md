# — GTA Online Macros —

This repository holds an AutoHotKey macro designed for GTA Online. The code in the script is harmless but not documented for the sake of readability. If you're familiar with AHK, there is no documentation required as the script is trivial. If you are unsure of what the script does, there's always the option of copy pasting a function to ChatGPT and asking it to document it line by line.
